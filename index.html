<div class="about">
    <p>For the past 10 years, I have dedicated my life to music education and performance.
        While I still love to perform and teach, the teaching profession has left me feeling
        unfulfilled. A career change is in order. The other field I have always been interested in
        is computers. So the perfect career to dive into is coding/programming. I am in my second
        month of learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. While most of these languages have been straight
        forward and easy to learn, I find myself struggling with some concepts. However, I have 
        always perserved through rough times to come out on the other end victorious. Welcome to my
        journey to becomming a full time programmer.
